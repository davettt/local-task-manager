## [1.6.0] - 2025-10-27

### Added

- Terminal mantra display with high-agency problem-solving framework
  - Matrix-themed terminal prompt at the top: `user@matrix:~$ Name it. Trace it. Fix it. Share it.`
  - Interactive hover tooltip showing detailed descriptions for each step
  - Configurable via `local_data/config.json` file
  - New `/api/config` endpoint for retrieving application configuration

### Changed

  - Search box and "+ NEW" button now share a single row (was 3 separate rows)
  - Button label shortened from "+ NEW TASK" to "+ NEW" for space efficiency

  - Reduced visual clutter by ~25% in header section

### Technical Details

## [1.5.0] - 2025-10-27

### Added

- Server instance management system to prevent race conditions and data loss
  - Single instance lock using PID-based lock file (`local_data/.lock`)
  - Automatic detection of already-running server instances
  - Clear error messages with PID, start time, and port information when attempting to run multiple instances
  - Stale lock file cleanup for crashed server instances
  - Graceful shutdown handling (SIGINT/SIGTERM) with automatic lock file cleanup
- Automatic port availability detection
  - Server now checks if default port (3000) is available
  - Automatically finds and uses next available port (up to 10 ports checked)
  - Clear visual indicator when fallback port is used
- Enhanced server startup messages
  - Formatted box-style console output showing server URL, status, and port information
  - Clear warnings when port fallback occurs

### Changed

- Server initialization refactored to async IIFE pattern for better control flow
- Lock file now stores PID, start timestamp, and active port
- Exit handlers now properly clean up lock file on all shutdown scenarios

### Technical Details

- `isPortAvailable()` - Tests port availability by attempting temporary server bind
- `findAvailablePort()` - Iterates through port range to find first available port
- `isProcessRunning()` - Validates lock file PID using signal 0 (non-destructive check)
- Lock file location: `local_data/.lock` (automatically cleaned on graceful shutdown)
- Multiple process protection prevents concurrent writes to `tasks.json`

## [1.4.0] - 2025-10-24

### Added

- Archive management system (Closes #8)
  - Daily archive files to prevent unbounded `tasks.json` growth
  - Automatic cleanup of archive files older than 45 days on server startup
  - Manual "Clean" button (ðŸ§¹) to move completed tasks to archive files
  - Modal dialog for selecting cleanup cutoff date
  - Tasks moved to daily archive files named `archive_YYYYMMDD.json`
  - New `archivedToFile` field indicates when task has been moved to archive file
  - All data is preserved - no tasks are permanently deleted unless archive files age out
  - Non-destructive operation with full data retention

### Changed

- Renamed "Archive" section to "âœ“ Completed" for better semantic clarity
- Completed tasks now show in "Completed" section until manually moved to archive files
- Archive header now displays as flex container for better button alignment
- Cleanup modal updated with clearer messaging about archive file movement

### Architecture

- **File Organization**: Completed tasks organized by date in separate JSON files
- **Backwards Compatible**: Existing archived tasks in `tasks.json` remain unchanged
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Server auto-deletes archive files older than 45 days
- **Manual Cleanup**: User can trigger cleanup to move old completed tasks from `tasks.json` to archive files
- **Data Integrity**: All moved tasks marked with `archivedToFile: true` for tracking
